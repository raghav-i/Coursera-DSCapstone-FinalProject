# Next Word Predict

This is the final project for the Coursera Data Science Specialization, Johns Hopkins University. It uses the data from the [HC Corpora Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip) dataset and using an n-gram algorithm, suggests succeeding words
in a sentence based on the particular sequence of text inputs. 

It is running at: https://raghav-i.shinyapps.io/shiny-app-new-words/

The slide deck explaining the application is: https://rpubs.com/raghav-i/next-word
